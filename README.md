# READ-O-HUB


The READ-O-HUB is basic Library Management System using the C programming language which  is a simplified yet functional software application designed to aid librarians in efficiently managing a library's operations

I have used the simple concept of functions to do any operations . Here issue and return of books is possible as well as you can display the details of students who issued the books. 

Adding and deletion of books is only possible through code , you cannot do it on user interface. Yes it is a drawback but this was my first project
